            <h2>Introduction to JEE</h2>
            <p>Till the year 2012, admissions in engineering courses of various Govt. / Pvt. Colleges and universities across India were being done through AIEEE and IIT-JEE. However, from the academic session 2013, AIEEE has been replaced by the JEE (Main) and IIT-JEE as JEE (Advanced). Only the top 150000 candidates (including all categories) based on performance in JEE (Main) will qualify to appear in the JEE (Advanced) examination. All the universities that previously accepted AIEEE scores will now accept JEE (Main) scores and IITs will select students on the basis of JEE (Advanced) marks. However few exceptions are there VITEEE, BITS-Pilani, IPU-CET, AMU and Manipal ( Engineering) which will conduct their own exams for admission into full time Engineering courses.</p>
            <h3>Admission Criteria</h3>
            <p>Admissions to IITs will be based only on category-wise All India Rank (AIR) in JEE (Advanced), subject to condition that suchcandidates are in the top 20 percentile categories. Admission to NITs will be based on 40 % weightage for performance in Class XII board marks (normalized) and the remainder 60 % weightage would be given to performance in JEE (Main) and a combined All India Rank (AIR) would be decided accordingly. The policy could also be adopted by other Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) and participating Institutions. In case any State opts to admit students in the engineering Colleges affiliated to state Universities where States require separate merit list to be provided based on relative weightages adopted by the states, then the merit list shall be prepared with such relative weightages as may be indicated by States. The examination will be conducted in the Regional Languages of the State(s) on the requests of such State(s).  </p>
            <h3>How can we help you</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left">Now admission in Good Institutes is based on two parameters, Board % and JEE Score, hence students have to prepare not only for JEE but have to perform well in their Board Examinations too.

            <h2>AIPMT (All India Pre-Medical Test)</h2>
            <p>In Academic Session 2013, NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test) was introduced replacing AIPMT and various other State Entrance Examinations. But as per the final decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, the Central Board of Secondary Education, CBSE will conduct an All India Pre-Medical/Pre-Dental Entrance Test for admission to MBBS/BDS Courses in several medical colleges around the country from academic session 2014. It is a yearly college entrance examination in India. Presently, 15% of the total seats in all medical and dental colleges run by the Union of India, state governments, municipal, or other local authorities in India, except in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, are reserved for candidates who qualify this examination.</p>
            <h3>Admission Criteria</h3>
            <p>National as well as State level ranking or Merit list will be prepared for all the appearing candidates. A student can use the National Rank to take admission in any of the AIPMT affiliated MBBS colleges in India, whereas, a State Rank can be used to take admission in any of the affiliated colleges in the state from where he/she holds a domicile. A minimum of 50% for General category and 40% for SC/ST/OBC category in Physics, Chemistry and Biology taken together is must for a student to hold in Class XII level. Admission in any college/universities does not include Board marks apart from above mentioned minimum eligibility.</p>
